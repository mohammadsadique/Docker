## [Chapter One: Docker Basic](https://github.com/mohammadsadique/Docker/blob/main/Chapter%201%20-%20Docker%20Basic/README.md) 

Chapter one teaches you how to run Docker using just two files: a Dockerfile and an index.php file. Since I'm working with PHP, I created a Dockerfile specifically for PHP. The first step is to set up a web server to run the project, and in this case, I'm using PHP 7.4 with Apache.
